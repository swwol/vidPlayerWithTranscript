Ah, she started provoking different gestures saying that my broher was there for the right reasons, and it's like, and I told her you don't know what you're talking about. Oh, yes, I do.\tHe's the one that raped me.\tAnd I says did you get that out of the line-up. I'm not even saying. You know. And it's like.\tYou mean to tell me there's not other people that look like him in town with long hair, bushy hair, stocky build, and I says there's other people how could you be sure it was him.\tHe's always been in trouble.And\tI'm like, that's not what I asked.\tHow do you know it was him that did it.\t\tIt was early in the morning, you know when the first incident supposedly happened.\tI don't know I wasn't there.
